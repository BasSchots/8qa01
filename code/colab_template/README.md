# Google Colab Template
This folder contains a template notebook for running your code in Google Colab. This example is similar to the template provided in the code folder, 
but has been adapted for use with Google Colab.

## How to use this notebook

First, make a project folder in google drive that can be shared with other group members. in this folder make the folders 
code, images, and masks. 
- The code folder should contain the notebook from this folder and the 
class2020_group00_functions.py file containing the functions. Also, upload the Excel or CSV files containing the labels to this folder. (for instance class2020_group00_labels.xlsx) 
 - The images folder should contain the lesion images. 
 - The masks folder should contain the mask images. 

After this, you can open the uploaded notebook in google colab. It is not necessary to upload the entire dataset to google drive (could take a long time). 
Upload only the images you need.
 
 Take note that is not possible to work on the same file simultaneously like google docs. You can solve this by making a 
 copy of the code folder for yourself, or per duo when pair programming (for instance code_FirstName). 
 You can work here and combine code later with other code made by your group. 
 
 You can also use google backup and sync to synchronize your project code folder to your computer.
 This ensures you can edit the functions file with spyder, and see any changes you make to functions in the colab 
 notebook.
