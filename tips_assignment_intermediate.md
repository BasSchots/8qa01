Initially you will work with a subset of 100 images, which are different for each group. The format is the same as of the file `class2020_group00_id.xlsx`. One image ID corresponds to one row, and one piece of information (such as a measurement of the image) corresponds to one column. 

There are two things you need to do in your assignment, measure the images by hand, and describe your plan for the final assignment.

### Intermediate assignment - part 1

* Label your group's images by hand ("op het oog") for one or more features you plan to measure. Per feature you need to have at least three people repeating the measurements, and each person measures all 100 images. 

* For example, if you measure two features, you can have persons A, B and C measuring feature 1, and persons D, E, F measuring feature 2. Your Excel file will then have 6 additional columns.

* You can decide yourself how to measure things, but the measurement has to be numerical. For example a binary score (0 = no, 1 = yes), a scale (for example 1 to 5), etc.  

* Follow the instructions of the template and use the same format.

* This data will allow you to start doing experiments early on, so that you can spread the work inside the group. 


### Intermediate assignment - part 2

* Write down a list of features you want to measure, and the strategy you plan to use. These steps should be similar to pseudocode, for example "resize the image, subtract original image from the smaller image" etc. 

*	A possible experiment to test out your method, what could you compare with what? You could use the measurements you create, to already try this out a bit. 

* The goal of this assignment is to get feedback on your plans, there is no grade.  

* Hand in both parts of the assignment in a ZIP file via Canvas. For the "report", you don't need to include an introduction etc, it is sufficient to describe the features and the possible experiment. The length should be 2-3 pages.
