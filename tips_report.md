# Final report

For your final assignment you need to hand in a report about your experiments and findings. The report can be in English or in Dutch (but not both at the same time).
Below you can find information about what sections to include in your report, and some general tips.

The length of the report is maximum 10 pages A4 with font size 11. This is excluding the title page, contents, references and appendices.


## Introduction

* Describe the problem, why is this relevant?
* What is your research question, what do you want to find out?
* How is this problem approached in the literature?
* What will you focus on in this report? It is better to have a more specfic focus, but motivate it and explain it well, than do a bit of everything, but poorly.

Tip: you will be reading quite a bit of scientific literature in this course. Have a look at one or two of the "best" papers you found, and try to see how they structure their introduction.

## Methods

* Global description of the method, for example with a flowchart
* Description of the measured features
* Description of the score prediction method

Here you should refer to previous work / literature on this topic. Indicate which ideas are your own.

You can use some (pseudo-)code here, if you alternate it with explaining the steps (so not just copy pasting lots of code). Use figures to intuitively illustrate various steps of methods.

If you use code that you find online (such as stackoverflow), please cite it with a link. Not citing work of others you use is considered plagiarism in the scientific world. The TU/e considers plagiarism to be a very harsh offence and blatant cases may be referred to the examination committee.

## Experiments and results

* Describe the steps which you use to test if your method is working
* Try to include both quantitative (numbers, such as accuracy) and qualitative (such as examples of images are classified incorrectly) results
* You do not have to show ALL results you get, but you can summarize some of them and show the most important ones. Other results can be included in the appendix.
* Interpret the results - what is your method doing well, and what can be improved?

## Discussion

* Summarize what you have done and how it relates to your main research question
* What is your method doing well, and what can still be improved?
* What other aspects, outside of what you investigated, would be important to consider for such a system?
* What are your recommendations for the future

## Appendix

* You can add additional results here
* You do NOT need to add the code or Excel sheets here, these are handed in separately in the ZIP file.


# General tips

* Think about who will read your report. Try to write for a target audience of students, who will do this course this year. New concepts should be therefore explained clearly but concisely.
* Be consistent in the terminology and abbreviations that you use.
* When showing figures, the caption should be readable stand-alone (clear by itself, without finding the explanation in the text)
* Break up long paragraphs so they are easier to read
* Follow the rules about the page limit etc.
