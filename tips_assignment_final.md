## Final assignment

For the final assignment you have to hand in your report and your code, in a ZIP file. Some tips:

*	Your script/function files should be called the same as the template, only with the group number adjusted. This script has to perform everything that is necessary to create your measurements and experiments.  

*	All necessary code (except common Python packages) needs to be included in the ZIP file. 

* Do NOT include the lesion images in the ZIP file. 

*	The code has to run if it is unzipped on a different computer, after changing the directory where the images are located.
