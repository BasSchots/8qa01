# Presentation

Your final presentation should be a Youtube movie where you briefly describe your project (maximum 3 minutes). This presentation should be aimed at a different target group than the students who did the same course, some examples: 

* Dermatologists
* High-school students who want to study at TUE
* People on a beach vacation
* Etc

You can choose this target group yourself. 

What is important is how you convey your message to the target group - it should be creative/memorable, but also a good fit so the target group can easily understand your message. 


## Tips

* Think about your message, what should your target group remember after the movie? 
* You can either record video, and/or use slides with a voice-over to create your video. Try to vary the types of fragments you have to keep the video engaging. 
* You probably do not need to explain every single step of your method 

* When adding images from external sources, please add a link to the source in that frame! 
* Do not use images which are copyrighted. In Google Image search in “Tools” you can select to only search for images "Labeled for re-use"
* You do not need to spend a lot of time on design (as this is not the goal of the course), but aim for a good quality of images/sound 

* Your video can be in English or in Dutch 
* 3 minutes is a hard limit, anything over 3 minutes will not be taken into account 
* You can create the video as "unlisted" on Youtube so only people with the link can view it, or public if you like
