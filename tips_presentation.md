# Presentation

Your final presentation should be a Youtube movie where you briefly describe your project (maximum 3 minutes). This presentation should be aimed at a different target group than the students who did the same course, so for example at dermatologists or high school students.

Important parts of the presentation is how your message is conveyed, ideally your presentation should be creative/memorable, and a good fit for the target group/easy to understand.
