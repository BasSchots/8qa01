# Presentation

*Note*: Depending on COVID measures, below might change. During the second COC, the definitive guidelines will be announced.

Your final presentation will consist of a 'performance' for your fellow students. This can take place in many forms: (YouTube) movie, theater play, game (quiz), anything goes as long as it is not a boring Powerpoint! The goal is to briefly describe your project (3 to max. 5 minutes). This presentation should be aimed at a different target group than the students who did the same course, some examples: 

* Dermatologists
* Old people
* High-school students who want to study at TU/e
* People on a beach vacation
* Etc

You can choose this target group yourself. 

What is important is how you convey your message to the target group - it should be creative/memorable, but also a good fit so the target group can easily understand your message. 


## Tips

* Think about your message, what should your target group remember after the presentation? 
* You can use pre-recorded video, and/or use slides with a voice-over to create your video, but this is not mandatory. Try to vary the types of fragments you have to keep the public engaged. 
* You probably do not need to explain every single step of your method, that's what the report is for.
* If you use a video, you please use some kind of microphone to record the voice-over. You can use one of the Jabras (vergadermicrofoon) to record the audio, or an old fashioned headset/microphone/earbuds.
* A bit of humor is, of course, always allowed. But remember, cancer is a serious subject!

* When adding images from external sources, please add a link to the source in that frame! 
* Do not use images which are copyrighted. In Google Image search in “Tools” you can select to only search for images "Labeled for re-use"
* Copyrighted music can get you kicked from YouTube, but there's a ton of copyright/royalty-free music available. Use it :)
* You do not need to spend a lot of time on design (as this is not the goal of the course), but aim for a good quality of images/sound 

* Your video can be in English or in Dutch 
* 5 minutes is a hard limit, anything over 300 seconds will not be taken into account. I will bring a nice buzzer to the final session which will buzz after the allotted time.
* Credits (for the references) do not count for the time. 
* You can create the video as "unlisted" on Youtube so only people with the link can view it, or public if you like
* If you decide to do something more interactive, like a quiz, I'll be a bit more lenient on time as audience participation is more unpredictable.
