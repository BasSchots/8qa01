# Getting started with code

Many of you will be new to coding when you start the project. That is OK - do not worry, several groups of students before you have done it already :) It is important to remember that you are are not "naturally" better or worse at programming, it is just a skill that can be learned and improved with practice. It IS a lot to learn at once, so do not worry if it seems overwhelming at first. 

To help you get started, there are various resources available:

* You will be following the Genomics course at the same time, where you will learn basics, like if statements and for loops. 
* A guide to working with Python used in the IMAG/e group is found here: https://github.com/tueimage/essential-skills/blob/master/python-essentials.md
* Online course https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/ 
* Online tutorial https://towardsdatascience.com/solving-a-simple-classification-problem-with-python-fruits-lovers-edition-d20ab6b071d2

You may use Github to work on your code together as a group, so that Github keeps track of which changes are made by whom. But this adds an extra step to what you need to learn, so it is optional! Instead if you just want to work together on the same files, you might want to look at Google Colab https://colab.research.google.com/, which works similar to Google Docs. 


## General tips

The goal of this project is to learn image analysis. Therefore your code will not be evaluated on how efficient it is. However, you want to pay attention to the following things:

* Does your code run on a different computer, after only adjusting the folder paths?
* Is your code separated from data? For example if you use some predefined values, they should be defined at the top of the script.
* Is the code using consistent and descriptive variable and function names? Is it clear what is happening?
* Are the comments helpful in explaining what is happening?
