# Getting started with code

Many of you will be new to coding when you start the project. That is OK - do not worry, several groups of students before you have done it already :) It is important to remember that you are are not "naturally" better or worse at programming, it is just a skill that can be learned and improved with practice. It IS a lot to learn at once, so do not worry if it seems overwhelming at first. 

There is already starter code available for you in this repository. If you have never coded before, the first goal for you should be to run this code. Then, you can make changes and see how it affects the final result. Google things you are not sure of as you need them - you do not need to "know" all the basics to get started.

Think of it as a board game with many rules, like Monopoly. If you read the instructions with the rules, and then start playing, you will probably have a more difficult time, than if you just start. 

Please note that having a person with programming experience, does not guarantee that your project will be more successful. One of the best projects so far was a group of 6 students, who have all not done any programming before, but they worked together and all learned a lot. 


## Working together

You may use Github to work on your code together as a group, so that Github keeps track of which changes are made by whom. BUT this adds an extra step to what you need to learn, so it is optional! Please ask me in Canvas discussions if you want to try this, and you need more help. 

Instead if you just want to work together on the same files, you might want to look at Google Colab https://colab.research.google.com/, which works similar to Google Docs. Here you will need to upload the images every time, or link your Google Drive, so that Google Colab has access to the images. 


## Resources

To help you get started, there are various resources available:

* You will be following the Genomics course at the same time, where you will learn basics, like if statements and for loops. 
* A guide to working with Python used in the IMAG/e group is found here: https://github.com/tueimage/essential-skills/blob/master/python-essentials.md
* Online course https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/ 
* Online tutorial https://towardsdatascience.com/solving-a-simple-classification-problem-with-python-fruits-lovers-edition-d20ab6b071d2

You are allowed to use any code you find online, just include the URL as a reference. 

## Pair programming

A technique you might want to try is to do pair programming. This means two people are working on one screen with code (in person, or virtually when sharing a screen). First one person is typing and explaining what they are thinking, and the second person helps with suggestions. Then they switch. 


## General tips

The goal of this project is to learn image analysis. Therefore your code will not be evaluated on how efficient it is. However, you want to pay attention to the following things:

* Does your code run on a different computer, after only adjusting the folder paths?
* Is your code separated from data? For example if you use some predefined values, they should be defined at the top of the script.
* Is the code using consistent and descriptive variable and function names? Is it clear what is happening?
* Are the comments helpful in explaining what is happening?
