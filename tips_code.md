# Getting started with code

Many of you will be new to coding when you start the project. That is OK - do not worry, several groups of students before you have done it already :) 

Here are some things to keep in mind:

* You will be following the Genomics course at the same time, where you will learn basics, like if statements and for loops. 
* A guide to working with Python used in the IMAG/e group is found here: https://github.com/tueimage/essential-skills/blob/master/python-essentials.md
* Here is another course for beginners: https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/ 

You may use Github to work on your code together as a group, so that Github keeps track of which changes are made by whom. But this adds an extra step to what you need to learn, so it is optional! Instead if you just want to work together on the same files, you might want to look at Google Colab https://colab.research.google.com/, which works similar to Google Docs.
